Associates serve as a resource for Lovett students, offering mentorship, academic and career advice, and some even play on Lovett’s intramural sports teams! (Fun fact: Lovett is the only residential college to have a former U.S. president serve as an associate, and we have the only Nobel Prize-winning associate too!) Lovett’s Associates program is coordinated by three elected student Associates coordinators. They organize events to facilitate interaction between Lovett students and Associates including semesterly Associates nights, Finals study breaks, and Senior Wine & Cheese tasting. <br> <br>

If you are interested in becoming a Lovett Associate, please email our college coordinator Sharon O’Leary <a href= mailto:sko1@rice.edu>sko1@rice.edu</a> for the application!

Johnson is a Professor of Computer Science and of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University and was previously a member of the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University for eight years. He received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in 1990 from Rice University. Professor Johnson founded and is leading the Monarch (MObile Networking ARCHitectures) research group at Rice (previously at Carnegie Mellon) and has worked substantially on the problems of Mobile IP and different types of multihop wireless networking such as mobile ad hoc networking, sensor networking, and mesh networking. He was very active in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal protocol standards development body for the Internet. He was one of the main designers of the IETF Mobile IP protocol standard for IPv4 and is the primary designer of Mobile IP for IPv6, and his group's Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) for wireless ad hoc networks has been published by the IETF as an Experimental protocol for the Internet. From 2005 through 2009, Professor Johnson served as the elected Chair of ACM SIGMOBILE, the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Mobility of Systems, Users, Data, and Computing; and was previously Treasurer of SIGMOBILE from 1997 through 2005; he also served two years as a member of the ACM SIG Governing Board Executive Committee (SGB EC). He is a member of the steering committee for the ACM MobiCom and MobiSys conferences; was General Chair for IEEE MASS 2012, COMSNETS 2011, MSN 2007, VANET 2006, and MobiCom 2003; and Technical Program Chair for VANET 2005, MobiHoc 2002, and MobiCom 1997.

I started as a student assistant in the Registrar's Office at a local community college and then began working full-time after my freshman year.  I didn’t complete my bachelor’s degree and return to college until later in life.  I attended an accelerated program in which I completed 62 hours in less than two years while working full time with twin daughters still in high school.  After that, I decided to keep on and received my masters as well.  I actually retired from the community college after 32 years and then began my second career here at Rice.  In addition to my position at Rice, I currently teach part-time at the community college and I always tell my students that I am the poster child for “It’s Never Too Late!”

I have been at Rice since May 2017, and I love getting to work with Rice students everyday. I really enjoy talking about travel, food, personal finance, Houston, and of course academic planning! Since I work on campus, I'm usually easy to get a hold of, and you are welcome to chat with me anytime. I hope to see you around the Lovett commons or in the Office of Academic Advising soon! </p>

My husband and I were both at Lovett (I was an archi and he was an econ major) and we have two kids who are often with us. I started my photography company, Water Oak Studio, while taking time away from the architecture industry. I taught at RSA for several years, but have transitioned to my current role as it encapsulates what I believe to be the best part of teaching: creating relationships and making connections for our students. I love making things, and spend most of my (limited) tv time knitting… And I’m happy to teach you how to knit, as well! I taught myself over winter break once year when I was very cold and missing Lovett. Beyond that, and most importantly, I want you to know that I am always available to talk or get coffee! </p>
